HOW TO UPLOAD THIS TO GITHUB
==============================

STEP 1: Download this folder
-----------------------------
First, you need to get the "noise-website" folder onto your computer.

Since downloads aren't working in Claude, try:
a) Claude Desktop App (claude.ai/download)
b) Different browser
c) I can show you how to copy/paste individual files

STEP 2: Create a new GitHub repository
---------------------------------------
1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: "san-mateo-noise-advocacy" (or whatever you want)
3. Description: "San Mateo Science Center HVAC noise complaint documentation"
4. Choose: Public (so others can see it)
5. DON'T check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

STEP 3: Push your files to GitHub
----------------------------------
Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows) and run these commands:

# Navigate to the noise-website folder
cd /path/to/noise-website

# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit: San Mateo Science Center noise advocacy website"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/san-mateo-noise-advocacy.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

STEP 4: Enable GitHub Pages (optional)
---------------------------------------
If you want to host the website on GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Click "Pages" in left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "main" branch
5. Click "Save"
6. Your site will be at: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/san-mateo-noise-advocacy/

ALTERNATIVE: If downloads still don't work
-------------------------------------------
I can create individual files you can copy/paste into GitHub's web interface:

1. Create repository on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. Name it (e.g., "index.html")
4. I'll give you the code to paste
5. Repeat for each file

Would you like me to do that instead?

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Problem: "git: command not found"
Solution: Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

Problem: Authentication error when pushing
Solution: You may need to set up a Personal Access Token
         Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens

Problem: Still can't download the folder
Solution: Let me know and I'll give you the code for each file individually
         so you can create them directly in GitHub's web interface

WHAT'S IN THIS FOLDER
---------------------
✅ 20 HTML files (complete website)
✅ README.md (documentation)
✅ .gitignore (Git configuration)

Total size: ~500 KB

NEXT STEPS AFTER UPLOADING
