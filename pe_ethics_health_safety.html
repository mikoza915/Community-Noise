        <p>Excessive noise exposure is recognized by:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>World Health Organization (WHO)</strong> - Environmental noise ranks second only to air pollution as an environmental cause of health problems</li>
            <li><strong>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</strong> - Noise pollution affects health and welfare</li>
            <li><strong>California Department of Public Health</strong> - Recognizes noise as environmental health hazard</li>
            <li><strong>Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)</strong> - Regulates workplace noise exposure</li>

        <h2>Engineer's Duty Upon Learning of Public Health Hazard</h2>

        <h3>Scenario: Post-Construction Discovery of Noise Impact</h3>

        <p>When an engineer learns that a system they designed is causing documented public health impacts (e.g., through noise complaints, measurements showing violations), their ethical obligations include:</p>

        <h4>1. Acknowledge and Investigate</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Take complaints seriously, not dismissively</li>
            <li>Review actual measurement data from affected parties</li>

            <li>Consider cumulative impact of multiple sources</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Recommend Corrective Action</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If violations exist, engineer must recommend mitigation</li>
            <li>Present technically feasible solutions with cost estimates</li>
            <li>Prioritize public health over client cost preferences</li>
            <li>Document recommendations in writing</li>

            <li>Notify appropriate authorities (code enforcement, health department)</li>
            <li>Document the refusal and notification</li>
            <li>May need to withdraw from further representation of client on this matter</li>

            <ul>
